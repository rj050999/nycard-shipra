  <h2>💌 A little note</h2>
  <p>
    Thank you for being my calm,  
    my laughter, and my comfort person💖  
    Life feels easier with you around. I cannot imagine my journey at
SIMS without you. I have learned so much from you and I am blessed and 
grateful to SIMS for giving you as my friend. You are more than just a friend for me,
and you know that right? I wish all the good things collectively happen to you in 2026
and you get all things that you have wished for, for yourself as well as for your family.
May god bless you. I will miss us being bench partners now. Two years in classroom with you have been 
so nice for me and fun too. I would wish for you as my bench-partner in all of my life. I wish we could do 
more things together. I cannot believe 2 years have passed!! I wish I could slow things down but thats not possible 
now. I hope to see you even after SIMS, and I know we will stay in touch forever. Happy New Year sweetie!!
